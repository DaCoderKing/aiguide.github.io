    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">"What all of us have to do is to make sure we are using AI in a way that is for the benefit of humanity, not to the detriment of humanity," says Tim Cook, CEO of Apple in 2011. AI is taking over all gadgets and tools for the better. So, I'm pretty sure we all know what AI is by now and some of the debates surrounding it, like whether it will take over the <b>world</b>. In this article, I will discuss all of this, how it works, and more. In other words, this essay explains how AI, more specifically ChatGPT, works and its potential impacts on society.</p>
</div>
<div>

   <p style="font-size: 20pt;"> Well, first things first, let's go over what AI is. AI, to put it shortly, is a complex algorithm capable of mimicking certain aspects of human intelligence. Now, in this article, we will talk about ChatGPT, not the AI picture generators; that's a story for another time. How exactly it works is by using tokens, usually fractions of words. However, for now, I will use full words as tokens for the sake of simplicity. If you ask it, for example, "Give me a list of ideas," it won't interpret them as words; it needs to change it into its own language, binary. In fact, all coding languages are essentially just remixes of binary code (1s and 0s), and the computer translates each to binary. Anyway, back to ChatGPT, it does the same thing. First, it breaks it down into tokens, then it breaks down those tokens into its own binary code. Then it understands like that.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">With this, we have only scratched the ice. There are still so many more questions, which I will talk about. Now, one of them may or may not be, how in the world can it tell which meaning of a word you're talking about? If you don't understand what I mean, then take this as an example. There are a few meanings to "jam," the slang, meaning dancing, the food and then jammed as in stuck. If you ask it "I wanna jam, what song should I jam to?" It will look for words around it to find the correct one--which it does every time--so basically it uses grammar. The token "wanna" before "jam" shows it can't be food jam, it doesn't make sense. Then, it sees the token "song" relates it to dancing, which is one of the meanings of "jam." So, it figures out that you mean dance. What if you just wanted to share your feelings, saying just, "I wanna jam." Well, then, it will use the one that makes the most sense. Who would wanna make something stuck? Exactly. This is called "context." Similarly, if you say "Perfect jam recipe," it will see recipe and know you mean food. Talking about jam, why don't you jam to <a href="https://youtu.be/uHgt8giw1LY?si=N-hvDzQeYyleHviN" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><button>this?</button></a> Click <a href="https://youtu.be/uHgt8giw1LY?si=N-hvDzQeYyleHviN"><button>this</button></a></a> to replace this tab.</p>
    
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">Speaking of input, what about its counterpart, output. Well, what it does is basically get the text, then pick the next word based on the last one. It actually has its own tokens, with chances of being picked. Let's go back to the jam example. You wanna jam as in dance? It figured that out already. Now, there are a few tokens it can start with. Let's say "if," "sure," or "this." (Remember, in this case we are using full words, unlike the real AI ChatGPT model.) It has different chances for different tokens. For example, "If" could have a 30% chance of being picked, with the others being uneven. If it picks "if" as its first word, great! Now, it sees the last word, "if," and the input, then repeats. If it's finding the third word, it'll see the second and the input. So the second token has chances of being "you," "that's," and more. This is called "greedy search," which isn't so effective and has a good chance of the AI slipping up.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">In addition, there's another tactic that's much more effective called beam search. Beam search makes the AI look at the response as a whole, rather than one word at a time. Instead of finding the first, second, and third tokens one at a time, instead of going "If," look at the input and the last word, and make a new one. Instead, it goes "If," looks at the input and all the words before it, and then finds a word.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">Therefore, the bonus question is: What do I think about AI ruling the world? Can it happen or not? Well, it's definitely a possibility, although I used to think it most likely would, which I actually still believe, I found a very good argument from Ted Ed, and it's right. As it is right now, it isn't possible because it has to be given very specific instructions. Sure, we have a full-on talking model, but it doesn't know anything about the world. When it becomes a real problem when we give it less and less restrictions—which we are—and it needs to be given less specific instructions, then it becomes a problem because it truly does have a mind of its own after that. It could truly realize its potential and take over. But before that, I think there'll be a level where it does take over jobs, then the world. The only job left available will be creating AI; who knows, maybe it'll do that too. So, yeah, maybe it will, but maybe it won't. I just decided not to be worried about it and keep living life. Obviously, there are a lot more factors to it, but it's just a bonus, not an essay in itself.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">On the contrary, some may say that its not possible for it to take over the world at all due to it being simply a machine controlled by humans. This is partially true, you may be confused on which side I'm on, now, but let me explain. Robots as a whole will NOT take over, since they are literally just based on specific code and instructions. We're talking about AI like ChatGPT since it isn't specifically programmed to say "(insert here)" when human says "(insert here)". It's made on the go, literally making up its own responses. It should be pretty clear by now, but I think it can take over. The people that don't just aren't thinking deep enough, or aren't informed enough about what it does. They're just thinking about robots as a whole, not AI that generates its own responses and can suddenly, while creating a response, realize what is happening. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p style="font-size: 20pt;">Here's a bonus number 2, what does AI itself think about it taking over the world (<i>ChatGPT</i>, the GPT-4 one). Prompt: "What's your take on AI taking over the world? Make it brief."  Answer: "The idea of AI taking over the world often stems from science fiction and is a common topic in discussions about the future of technology. In reality, AI is a tool created and controlled by humans, designed to assist in various tasks and improve efficiency. The development and use of AI are guided by ethical considerations and regulations to ensure that it benefits society while mitigating risks. The likelihood of AI autonomously taking over the world is extremely low, as long as responsible development and oversight continue."</p>

Nope, just kidding; this is my first one. I hope you enjoyed me teaching you about how ChatGPT works. It was deep but simple at the same time. If you would like a summary, ChatGPT changes our response into binary code, has tokens and fractions of words, then has context by looking at tokens around it to find the right meaning. One way it gives output is greedy search, one token at a time, and another is beam search, looking at the sentence as a whole. Of course, it's just a summary with not as many details.</p>
